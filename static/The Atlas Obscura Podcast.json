Check out the Atlas entry for Elmer McCurdy’s grave.  \n\nFor more information on Elmer, we recommend Mark Svenvold’s book “Elmer McCurdy: The Misadventures in Life and Afterlife of an American Outlaw.”",

Plus, we revisit a recent conversation with author Dorthe Nors to learn more about the burnings of witch effigies along the rugged Danish coast.\n\nFor more from Women Who Travel, visit their website.",
